# ekm-product-inventory-updater
Simple app which uses a .csv file to update product quantities and prices in the `EKM - Advanced Inventory Manager`.  
This previously used their API, however they're now charging a lot of extra money for that service.  
This now uses [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) to automate the manual update process.  
It's much slower, but free of charge!  

## Installation

**This app requires `node.js v12.18.3`.**  

Then:

    $ git clone https://github.com/b3nThomas/ekm-product-inventory-updater.git
    $ cd ekm-product-inventory-updater
    $ npm i
    $ npm run build

## Setup

In order to run this app, you must do the following:

### EKM Auth
  - Create a file in the `app` folder called `auth.json`
  - Copy the content from `./app/auth.json.template` into your new file
  - Update the field values to include your EKM login credentials
  - These credentials are ignored by .git so will only ever exist on your local machine üëç

### Input CSV file
  - From your source of truth for stock quantites and prices, export a simple report named `data.csv`, based on `./app/data.csv.template`  
  - Move the file to `./app/data.csv`  
  - When run, the tool will use this data to update the stock quantites in EKM  

## Usage

    $ npm run start

Job's a gooden üëç

## Reporting
A timestamped report will be outputted under `./reports` which contains all updates and errors that occurred during an import.
